# Angular-initializr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.6.

This is a angular start project, which will reduce the complexity of settings up
a base project everytime.

I have tried to follow all the best practices, from official and other Angular geeks ;)
and have added customize material theme, angular flex-layout, navGuards, Http-interceptor,
Lazy loading, json-server, proxy-config.json etc.

I have also replace `Jasime & Karma` with `Jest` (with some unit testing) to increase the performance,
this starter project also comes with `Cypress` testing framework (example included).

I have added Login and home component with some code, so that you get familiar with
this starter project.

I hope you enjoy it and find it interesting :D
